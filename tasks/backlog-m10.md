# Backlog — M1: DevOps Fundamentals

**Goal:**  
Learn Linux, Git, Docker and CI/CD; integrate pipeline into Sala/Coworking.

**Draft scope (to be detailed later):**
- Dockerfile multi-stage + docker-compose
- GitHub Actions pipeline: build → test → docker push
- Add coverage badge + health/readiness checks
- Logging & runbook for deploy/rollback

*(Full backlog will be added at the start of M1 phase)*
